## Introduction

This dataset contains penguin data collected in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER. The data includes information about penguin species, culmen length and depth, flipper length, body mass, island name, and penguin sex.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to Dr. Kristen Gorman, Palmer Station LTER, and the LTER Network for making the data available.

## Data Description

### penguins_size.csv

Simplified data containing the following variables:

- `species`: Penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
- `culmen_length_mm`: Culmen length (mm)
- `culmen_depth_mm`: Culmen depth (mm)
- `flipper_length_mm`: Flipper length (mm)
- `body_mass_g`: Body mass (g)
- `island`: Island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago
- `sex`: Penguin sex

### penguins_lter.csv

Original combined data for 3 penguin species (aggregated from individual links).

## What are Culmen Length & Depth?

The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak." For penguins, culmen length and depth are measured as shown in the provided images.
